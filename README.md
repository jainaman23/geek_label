This project had lots of features and have been successfully developed. I have implemented my approach for both _front-end_ and _back-end_. I tried to show different approach for same problem wherever possible. This theme is using two fonts one is **“Open Sans”** and Other is **“Meuse”** Both of them are **not free available** so decided to use _“opensans”_ indeed, which is different from “Open Sans”. I know it will have some impact to overall design but i tried to make its look and feel same as design. I hope you will like it.

# Front-End Approach
I have developed this theme with the help of bootstrap and fullpage.js. All layout and base structure is of bootstrap and I have used grid system of bootstarp. All css has been written in style.css and js in global.js. Created full page with help of fullpage.js and rest is almost same as i have done in opencharity.

# Landscape Mode
This feature I have added for landscape mode esecially for iPhone as i dont have design for landscape mode and its little difficult for me to shirnk all content to get fit into landscape. So I decided to not to show content in ladscape mode for all screen less than size of 767px.
